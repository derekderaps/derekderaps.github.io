##about:derek
I travel, cycle, write, meditate, read fiction, watch indie movies, walk in the woods, and listen to NPR podcasts like Radio Lab and On Being. I am an uncle. I let others curate great music for me via Hype Machine, 8tracks, and SoundCloud. My cell phone is a Hangouts window on my laptop; no devices to clutter my pockets or eat my soul!

I code in **vim**. I am not a full-stack developer: I work from **Javascript** down... **PHP**, **bash**, etc. I debug in **PHPStorm**. I train folks in **git** and **drush**. I use opinionated approaches to **sites directory layouts** and [**installation profiles**](https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/your-drupal-site-platform). I prefer a lean, mean local stack over **vagrant** but am flirting with **docker**. I geek out on **performance tuning** where it counts. **Object-oriented** programming is in my DNA. I am an expert in **Panels** and **CTools** but look forward to building **Drupal 8** sites without them. I enjoy playing with **Node.js** frameworks. **Decoupled** implementations are the future!

I am a passionate programmer, and that means I value my **team** over the code or the client. **Mentoring** is a joy, both in giving and receiving. I focus on improving **process** and **workflow** to minimize inefficient execution. A website without **beautiful code** is fragile and [expensive](https://twitter.com/c089/status/671624868908126208); elegance wins.

##Noteworthy Projects
**Weather.com**
Created a world-class editorial experience for The Weather Channel's global team of editors. Overcame tight deadlines and shifting priorities to deliver a highly performant and reliable product that shines. Gained a depth of experience in ***migration*** of legacy content, ***Batch*** + ***Queue*** API implementations, ***Angular*** mods, ***ESI*** routing, ***Panels*** plumbing, ***i18n***, Entity ***Translation***, and ***WYSIWYG*** rich media (embeddable entities).

**Habitat for Humanity**
Worked to build client trust by first showing success with a few small projects. Provided free training to empower their development team. Implemented a content server workflow to allow their editors to build content in one environment then deploy it to production. Successfully established a strong working relationship that set up the organization for success in a full redesign.

**Georgia Tech Research Institute**
Led a team in building a secure intranet that facilitates departmental communication, compliance, and organizational cohesion. Utilized installation profiles and programmatic content creation to standardize the team's development environments.

**Emory University, Tetramer Core Facility**
Revolutionized the client's workflow by automating and streamlining their order intake process with a ***Drupal Commerce*** implementation. Built an object-oriented, fail-safe, bi-directional synchronization framework to keep the website up to date with the staff's FileMaker database.
