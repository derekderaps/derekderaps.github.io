## about:hawkeye

A few things about me: I enjoy cycling and working on my steel-framed Salsa Pistola. I like writing in my journal; it helps me sort out how I'm feeling about things. I love reading fiction but only do so occasionally because, once I start, I have trouble putting it down. I listen to history podcasts, streaming episode after episode while working in the yard. I own a home in Chattanooga, TN and find pleasure in many of the mundane tasks I once swore-off as a teenager. I am an uncle twice over. I crowdsource beautiful chillstep playlists via Hype Machine, 8tracks, and IndieShuffle.

My primary code editors are **vim** and the GitHub interface. I am proudly not a full-stack developer but enjoy learning at all the levels. I am big on **git hygiene**. I geek out on hunting down and finding creative, efficient solutions to canceling technical debt. I take great pleasure in writing and reviewing elegant, **object-oriented** code. I am an expert in **Paragraphs** and **component-based Drupal integrations** but look forward to building new UX tools on top of Layout Builder ([Inline Blocks](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2957425) coming in Drupal 8.6+).

## Drupal 8 projects

_Architect and lead developer_

[**San Jose Water**](https://www.sjwater.com/) (2018)
Implemented WCAG 2.0 **accessibility** standards that achieved a SiteImprove score close to 100 and saved the client from pending lawsuits. The project also represented a big leap forward in **editorial UX** for our team, having learned much from the pain points of previous D8 + Paragraphs implementations.

[**Google Vision API + Content Moderation**](http://live-visionapi.at.kalamuna.com/) (2018)
Collaborated with Google and Pantheon to demonstrate the capabilities of Google Vision in a Drupal environment. Not much to see in the demo site above; check out the code sample (see "code samples" below) or request an authenticated-user walk-through.

[**City and County of San Francisco Human Services Agency**](https://www.sfhsa.org/) (2017)
Led a multidisciplinary team that included client developers.

[**Fair Trade USA**](https://www.fairtradecertified.org/) (2017)
Executed a website redesign that included Salesforce integration points.

[**UCSF School of Dentistry**](https://dentistry.ucsf.edu/) (2017)
Migrated legacy content. Ported Kalagraphs (see "code samples" below) from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.

_Drupal 8 expertise consultant_

[**Kalamuna.com blog**](https://blog.kalamuna.com) (2016)
Launched one of the first public-facing Drupal 8 sites at Kalamuna.

## Drupal 8 code samples

[**Vision API proof-of-concept in collaboration with Google and Pantheon**](https://gitlab.com/hawkeyetwolf/visionapi/tree/master/web/modules/custom/visionapi)
Google public webinar demo [forthcoming](https://pantheon.io/resources/artificial-intelligence-your-cms).

[**drupal-project**](https://github.com/kalamuna/drupal-project) and [**Kalaconfig**](https://github.com/kalamuna/kalaconfig)
Composer template and custom module that combine to provide a robust starting point for new projects. It saves 10's of hours of initial configuration and continues providing value throughout the life of the project by providing config splits for each environment (local, dev, test, prod).

[**Kalagraphs**](https://github.com/kalamuna/kalagraphs)
Facilitates rapid development of components from a styleguide (e.g., kss or Pattern Lab) to implementation (Drupal via Paragraphs).

[**Autogrow Textarea**](https://github.com/kalamuna/autogrow_textarea)
Adds [jQuery NS-Autogrow](https://github.com/ro31337/jquery.ns-autogrow) to Drupal's textarea Form API element.

[**Drupal VM**](https://github.com/kalamuna/drupal-vm)
This fork of Drupal VM supported both client and vendor team members through several Drupal 8 builds.

## Other noteworthy projects

[**Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco "Insights"**](https://insights.famsf.org/) (2018)
When the client's budget and priorities did not allow for a Drupal back-end, we worked with their existing technical staff to create a yaml-based content solution. This empowered our team to focus on delivering the front-end experience FAMSF desired while providing just the right amount of content flexibility. Hosted as a static website on Netlify.

[**Progenity.com**](https://www.progenity.com/) (2017)
Implemented the outcomes of a complete brand redesign. Created the first version of Kalagraphs (see "code samples" above).

[**UCSF Dental Center**](https://www.ucsfdentalcenter.org) (2016)
Leveraged the [Groups](https://www.drupal.org/project/group) module to support just the right amount of subsite content flexibility and custom branding.

**Weather.com** (2015)
Solved a major pain point for The Weather Channel by creating a flexible, easy-to-use editorial experience for their global team of editors. Overcame tight deadlines and shifting priorities to deliver a highly performant and reliable web presence. Gained a depth of experience in ***migration*** of legacy content, ***Batch*** + ***Queue*** API implementations, ***AngularJS*** mods, ***ESI*** routing, ***Panels*** plumbing, ***i18n***, Entity ***Translation***, and ***WYSIWYG*** rich media (embeddable entities).

**Habitat for Humanity** (2015)
Worked to build client trust by first showing success with a few small engagements. Provided training to empower their development team. Implemented a "content server" workflow to allow their editors to build content in one environment then deploy it to production. Successfully established a strong working relationship that set up the organization for success in a full redesign.

**Georgia Tech Research Institute** (2015)
Led a team in building a secure intranet that facilitates departmental communication, compliance, and organizational cohesion. Utilized installation profiles and programmatic content creation to standardize the team's development environments.

[**Emory University, Tetramer Core Facility**](http://tetramer.yerkes.emory.edu) (2014)
Streamlined the client's workflow by automating and streamlining their order intake process with a ***Drupal Commerce*** implementation. Built an object-oriented, fail-safe, bi-directional synchronization framework to keep the website up to date with the staff's FileMaker database.
