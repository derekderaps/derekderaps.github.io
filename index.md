####about:derek

I travel, cycle, write, meditate, read fiction, watch indie movies, and listen to NPR podcasts like Radio Lab and On Being. I like trying new things. I have neither pets nor children. I let others curate great music for me via Hype Machine, 8tracks, and SoundCloud. My cell phone is a Hangouts window on my laptop; no devices to clutter my pockets or eat my soul!

I code (in **vim**) from **Javascript** down. I debug in **PHPStorm**. I train folks in **git** and **drush**. I use opinionated approaches to **sites directory layouts** and **installation profiles**. I prefer a lean, mean local stack over **vagrant** but am flirting with **docker**. I geek out on **performance tuning** from stack to CMS. I am an expert in **Panels** and **CTools** but look forward to building **Drupal 8** sites without them. I enjoy playing with **Node.js** frameworks.

I value **process** and **workflow** over inefficient execution. A website without **beautiful code** is fragile and [expensive](https://twitter.com/c089/status/671624868908126208); elegance wins. **Object-oriented** programming is in my DNA. **Decoupled** implementations are the future!
